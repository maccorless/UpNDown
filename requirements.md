# Up-N-Down - Requirements Specification

## 1. Game Overview
A cooperative multiplayer card game where players work together to play all their cards on four different foundation piles. Players must communicate and strategize to succeed, as all players either win or lose together.

## 2. Game Rules

### 2.1 Basic Setup
- **Player Count**:
  - Multiplayer: 2-8 players
  - Solitaire: 1 player
- **Card Deck**: Numbered cards with configurable range (default: 2-99)
- **Four Foundation Piles**:
  - Two ascending piles (starting at 1, or one less than minimum card value)
  - Two descending piles (starting at 100, or one more than maximum card value)
- **Starting Hands**:
  - Default: 7 cards per player
  - Configurable via settings
- **Draw Pile**: Remaining cards after initial deal
- **Configurable Settings**: Card range, hand size, player limits, minimum cards per turn, auto-refill behavior

**Status**: ✅ **Implemented**

### 2.2 Gameplay Mechanics

#### Turn Structure (Multiplayer)
- Players must play minimum 2 cards per turn while draw pile has cards
- During final stage (draw pile empty), minimum reduces to 1 card per turn
- Players may play more than the minimum if they choose
- No time limit for turns
- When a player ends their turn, they draw replacement cards from draw pile (up to hand size)
- **Status**: ✅ **Implemented**

#### Solitaire Mode
- Continuous play with no turn restrictions
- Play as many cards as possible each round
- Auto-refill always enabled
- **Status**: ✅ **Implemented**

#### Card Placement Rules
- **Ascending piles**: Play cards with higher values than top card
- **Descending piles**: Play cards with lower values than top card
- **Special "Backward-10" Rule**:
  - Ascending piles: Can play a card exactly 10 lower than current top card
  - Descending piles: Can play a card exactly 10 higher than current top card
- **Status**: ✅ **Implemented**

#### Hand Management
- Auto-refill option (configurable):
  - **Enabled**: Draw immediately after playing each card
  - **Disabled**: Draw all replacement cards at turn end
- Solitaire mode always uses auto-refill
- **Status**: ✅ **Implemented**

#### Player Elimination Handling
- When a player runs out of cards in multiplayer, their turn is automatically skipped
- Game continues with remaining players who have cards
- **Status**: ✅ **Implemented**

#### Undo Functionality
- Players can undo the last card played if enabled in settings
- Configurable option in game settings
- **Status**: 🔄 **Planned** (UI exists, backend implementation needed)

### 2.3 Win/Loss Conditions

#### Win Condition
- All players successfully play all their cards from their hands
- Cooperative victory - all players win together
- **Status**: ✅ **Implemented**

#### Loss Condition
- The current player cannot make the required minimum plays on their turn
- Game automatically detects when no valid moves exist
- All players lose together
- **Status**: ✅ **Implemented**

### 2.4 Player Communication

#### Foundation Pile Preferences (Future)
- Players can mark piles as "like", "really like", or "love" when not their turn
- Purely communicative - no mechanical effect
- Signals to other players that they have beneficial cards for that pile
- Preferences reset when player's turn starts
- **Status**: 🔄 **Planned** (code structure exists, needs activation)

## 5. Architecture Details

### Client-Server Communication
```
Client → Socket.IO Event → Server
Server → Validates & Updates Firebase
Server → Callback Response → Requesting Client
Server → Broadcast Event → Other Clients
All Clients → Update Local State
```

### Socket.IO Events (Implemented)
- `game:create` - Create new game
- `game:join` - Join existing game
- `game:leave` - Leave game
- `game:start` - Start game
- `game:playCard` - Play a card
- `game:endTurn` - End current turn
- `game:checkStatus` - Check win/loss status
- `game:setPilePreference` - Set pile preference (structure exists)

### Game State Management
- **Server**: Single source of truth in Firebase
- **Client**: React Context for local state management
- **Synchronization**: Real-time via Socket.IO with callback acknowledgments

### Type Safety
- Shared TypeScript interfaces between client and server
- Full type definitions for game state, players, cards, settings
- Compile-time type checking prevents runtime errors

## 6. Quality Assurance

### Testing Approach
- Manual testing for all game scenarios
- Test cases:
  - Game creation and joining
  - Card playing and turn progression
  - Win/loss detection
  - Player disconnection/reconnection
  - Statistics calculation
  - Settings application
  - Solitaire mode
  - Edge cases (empty hands, draw pile exhaustion)

### Known Issues & Solutions
1. **Firebase Empty Array Conversion**: Solved with defensive `(array || [])` pattern
2. **React Hooks Violations**: Solved by removing early returns before hooks
3. **TypeScript Build Errors**: All 15 errors resolved for production builds
4. **Statistics Not Persisting**: Fixed by including players array in Firebase updates

## 7. Deployment Considerations

### Development Environment
- Client dev server: http://localhost:5173 (Vite)
- Server dev server: http://localhost:3001 (ts-node-dev)
- Firebase Realtime Database with open rules (dev only)

### Production Requirements
- Build both client and server TypeScript
- Configure production Firebase rules with authentication
- Set production environment variables
- Configure CORS for production domain
- Consider CDN for client static assets

## 8. Future Technical Enhancements

### Performance
- Optimize Firebase read/write operations
- Implement client-side caching
- Lazy load components
- Code splitting for faster initial load

### Scalability
- Separate Firebase instances for dev/staging/prod
- Rate limiting on Socket.IO events
- Game state cleanup for abandoned games
- Database indexing for quick game lookups

### User Experience
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- Offline game mode (solitaire only)
- Sound effects and music
- Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Internationalization (i18n) support

## 9. Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Zero runtime type errors
- Sub-100ms Socket.IO round-trip time
- 100% game state consistency across clients
- Successful builds for both client and server

### User Experience Metrics
- Game creation success rate
